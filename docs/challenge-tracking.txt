## Challenge Tracking

Create threads to track challenges during a CTF.

### Commands
- `/chall <category> <name>` - Create a challenge thread
- `/solved` - Mark as solved (run inside thread)
- `/unsolved` - Reset to unsolved
- `/status` - View all challenges
- `/delchall` - Delete challenge (creator/admin only)

### Workflow
1. In the CTF channel: `/chall web login-bypass`
2. A thread is created for discussion
3. Chatting in thread auto-tracks you as working on it
4. Run `/solved` when done - announces to main channel with solve time
5. Multiple people can `/solved` the same challenge
